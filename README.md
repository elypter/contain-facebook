# Subreddit Container

**Prevent Reddit from tracking your visits to other websites**

Subreddit Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Reddit from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use reddit while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Subreddit Container work?

The Add-on keeps Subreddits in a separate Container to prevent reddit from following your activity on other subreddits. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Reddit and deletes the cookies that reddit uses to track you. 

Every time you visit a Subreddit, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to each Subreddit within its own container.  When browsing outside the container, Reddit won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your individual Subreddit identities.

## How do I enable Subreddit Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Subreddit Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/Subreddit-container/). This will log you out of Reddit and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Reddit and use it like you normally would. Firefox will automatically switch to the Subreddit Container tab of that Subreddit for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of registered Subreddit or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Subreddit Container

## How does this affect Subreddit’s features?

Subreddit Containers prevents Subreddit from linking your activity on other websites to your Subreddit identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### “Like” buttons and embedded Subreddit comments on other websites.

Because you are logged into Subreddit only in the Container, “Like” buttons and embedded Subreddit comments on other websites will not work.

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Subreddit

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Subreddit will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Subreddit completely?

This add-on does not prevent Subreddit from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Subreddit still will have access to everything that you do while you are on Subreddit.com or on the Subreddit app, including your Subreddit comments, photo uploads, likes, and any data you share with Subreddit connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Subreddit activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Subreddit settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Subreddit. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
